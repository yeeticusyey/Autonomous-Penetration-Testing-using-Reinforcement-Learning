# Autonomous Penetration Testing using Reinforcement Learning



Made some modifications to the repo since I saw it empty, hope you don't mind

-- Phyllis 



I've added CyberBattleSim as a submodule, so we'll be using it more as a library as compared to modifying CyberBattleSim itself. All modifications should be done in the /Modifications folder.



Note that since CBS is submodules, when you clone this repo you should use:

```
git clone https://github.com/yeeticusyey/Autonomous-Penetration-Testing-using-Reinforcement-Learning --recursive
```

Else, the CyberBattleSim folder will be empty. If you have already cloned it and it's currently empty, use the command `git submodule update --init `
